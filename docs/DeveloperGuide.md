### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete mod 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI Component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ModuleListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Module` objects residing in the `Model`.
- keeps a reference to the current screen state as a `GuiState` in order to restrict some commands to certain screens (more on this under `Restricting Commands based on GUI state` in the `Implementation` section below).
- changes the screen based on the return value of CommandResult.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to change UI screen based on the command**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Create card classes for each type of screen and change rendered card based on return value of CommandResult.
    - Pros: Readability is enhanced, easily extendable.
    - Cons: Coupling of UI component is reduced; logic needs to be added to CommandResult to change the current screen.
- **Alternative 2**: Have a single rendered ModuleCard that changes text based on the type of the object in the ObservableList.
    - Pros: Easier to implement.
    - Cons: Harder to extend; can lead to a monolithic ModuleCard that handles all views.

### Logic Component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ModBookParser` class to parse the user command together with the current state of the GUI (`GuiState`).
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddModCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a module).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete mod 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete mod 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `ModBookParser` class creates a `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `DetailCommand`) which the `ModBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- The name of the `Command` Object may also include the type of object the command is acting on. For example, `delete mod` command returns a `deleteModCommand` object, `delete lesson` command returns a `deleteLessonCommand` object and `delete exam` command returns a `deleteExamCommand` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model Component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the ModBook data i.e., all `Module` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueModuleList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Module` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage Component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

![StorageClassDiagram](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component,

- can save both module data and user preference data in `JSON` format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `ModBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

The sequence diagram of how this works for an `add lesson` command is found below. The objects in `Model` and `UI`, as well as time-related objects, are omitted for simplicity.

![StorageSequenceDiagram](images/StorageSequenceDiagram.png)

When storing the `ModBook`, the respective `JsonAdaptedObject` classes will create adaptations of objects in the `Model`, allowing `JsonUtil` to store the objects and save them to the `filePath` specified in `UserPrefs`.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to save components of Modules (Lesson / Exam / Timeslot / ModBookTime / ModBookDate):**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Create respective `JsonAdaptedObject` classes for each type of object.
    - Pros: Greatly increases the readability of the JSON storage file
    - Cons: Many objects must be created when a Lesson or Exam is being stored.
- **Alternative 2**: Encode `Lesson`, `Exam` and other components into `String` objects to be stored as properties of a `JsonAdaptedModule`.
    - Pros: Easier to implement the writing of JSON files.
    - Cons: Difficult to parse JSON output - have to figure out how to decode `String` objects to `Lesson`, `Exam` and other objects in the `Model`.

### Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

---

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Restricting Commands based on GUI state

#### Rationale

Some commands, e.g. `delete lesson` and `edit exam` should not be used in the view where the `Modules` are listed.
This is because the `delete` and `edit` commands are indexed based, and in the `Modules` view, there are multiple `Lessons` or `Exams` displayed with the same index.
Hence, there is a need to restrict these commands to the Module Details view, so that there is no ambiguity about which `Lesson` or `Exam` to delete.

Thus, before commands are executed, the GUI state of the application needs to be checked to see if it is valid.

#### Implementation

To implement this feature, the GUI needs to keep track of which state it is in, so a field in `MainWindow` was created to store the `GuiState`.
In addition, the `Logic#execute()` method has an additional `GuiState` parameter, which will be the current `GuiState` of the `MainWindow`, and the `Parser` interface was modified so that `parse` also takes in a `GuiState` parameter.
After the command is executed, the `GuiState` of the `MainWindow` is updated with the `GuiState` of the returned `CommandResult`.

The class diagram of how UI and Logic interact with each other is shown below.

![LogicGuiStateClassDigram](images/LogicGuiStateClassDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram of how this works for a `delete` command is found below. The objects in `Model` and `Storage` are not shown for simplicity.

![GuiStateSequenceDiagram](images/GuiStateSequenceDiagram.png)

When parsing, the respective `Parser` will check the current `GuiState` with the allowed `GuiState`s. If the `GuiState` is valid, it will proceed with parsing the command.
Otherwise, it will throw a `GuiStateException`.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to implement edit/delete lessons/exams:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Limits these two commands to the Module Details view.
    - Pros: Easier to implement.
    - Cons: Requires passing `GuiState` from the `UI` component to the `Logic` component, reducing cohesion.
- **Alternative 2**: Combine the lists of lessons and exams into one central list in the List Lessons or Exams view respectively.
    - Pros: Does not require `MainWindow` to keep track of its current `GuiState`.
    - Cons: Difficult to implement - have to figure out how to map the `Lesson` or `Exam` from the central list to its original module.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Rewriting entity types
As ModBook uses completely different entity types than AB3 (e.g. Module, Lesson), we had to write our entity classes from scratch, and implement custom methods that were required for the classes to function well. In addition to rewriting classes in `Model`, we also had to rewrite the classes in `Storage` to ensure that our entities could be written to and read in JSON.

### Implementing showing next Lesson
ModBook displays the next lesson of a module based on the systemâ€™s day and time. We implemented the lesson `Day` as an enumeration so that we did not have to worry about wrong inputs, but then we realised that Java enumerations do not allow the `compareTo` method to be overridden. Hence, we had to implement a custom `Comparator` for `Day` which offset the `Day` ordinal value by the current system day, and performed modulo arithmetic to make sure everything worked properly.

### Implementing `Edit` command
Edit was certainly the most time consuming feature to do, and also the feature that is most vulnerable to bugs. It effectively has the complexity of both deleting and adding a new object, while considering some additional complications from having optional fields such as requiring both start and end timings in order to modify a timeslot. As such, we had to ensure our test cases were rigorous.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
For the GUI, we made three additional GUI screens to display different information, and we also had to work out how to get the view to change based on the command that was executed. This was a challenge as we only allowed for certain commands to be executed in certain views. Weighing the pros and cons of different implementations, we decided to go with updating the `CommandResult` to return a value which changes the current screen view.
